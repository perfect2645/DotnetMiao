## Self Introduce
Thank you for considering my profile!
My name is Cui Fawei, you can call me Fawei. I’m a software developer with over **15 years of experience**. 
I spent around a decate as a WPF programmer earlier in my career. Years ago I found i need to expand my tech skill, so dive into self-study, 
I picked up web frontend tech such as html/css/javascript, study other aspects of C# such as webapi and some spider applications.
Eventually the learning paid off: I transitioned into a full-stack role, 
where i am now switching on WPF / react application, backend services as well as CI/CD pipelines.
I’m really passionate about building efficient and innovative software solutions and I like working in collaborative team environments.
Because of my focus on delivering reliable and scalable solutions, I was promoted to Application Manager in my team, where I am now managing the application lifecycle in my team.

Let me say something about life
I am currently based in the coastal city of **Dalian**, I am happily **married** and have a wonderful **daughter** who inspires me every day. With the full **support of my family**, I am now actively **seeking new career opportunities across China**. I am open to relocation for the right role where I can do contributtion and continue growing professionally.

Outside of work. I like listening music
I love exploring nature with my daughter, spending time with my family, and staying curious about new technologies and cultures. I bring this same energy and dedication to everything I do.  
I am excited about the possibility of bringing my expertise, and positive outlook to a forward-thinking team. Thank you again for considering my profile!

## Conflict with teams

## Conflict in my team

- First off, I'd try to calm things down.
- After the folks calming donw, pull the folks involved aside one by one.
- Listen his mind without cutting him off.
- Get the basic understanding of the conflict, value conflict or just arguement about tech
- Bring out our team goals, talk to him easy and sincerely, say maybe some argue is good, 
  everybody has his own point of views
- Not a write or wrong issue.

## Prod issue handle
- Immediately isolate the affected service, block abnormal access, and stop further data leakage.
- Think if any workaround would take effect and use it for temporary.
- Trace the source via logs (e.g., ELK), check for permission flaws or system vulnerabilities.

prevent similar issue happens again.
