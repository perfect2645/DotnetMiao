## Answer

I was on SC website and one line really resonates with me: 'You’ll be seen as a future leader with the potential to change not just the future of banking, but the future of the world.'
I’m not just looking for a tech job, every developer dreams of building solutions that impact the world.
I know Standard Chartered you don’t just ask for that big vision, you encourage employees on the divercity of work / life balence through activities volunteering or just respecting personal time,
that recharged employees driving better innovation, pursuiting of excellence.

I was working on the Equity finance team in Citi which worked for Middle Office and using similar tech stack C# / Java directly aligns with what I see in this job description.

At last I am applying this role because i meet the overlap "What I am passionate about" with "the career opportunity needs my skills".
I am hoping to building solutions that reaches users worldwide and as I grow here, I’d love to step into a tech leadership role, mentor others shaping the future of how SC builds solutions and this role is the perfect place to start that journey.


## Why HCBC

My departure was due to the bank’s strategic decision to close its China sites. 
While it was not my personal choice to leave, I deeply appreciate the experience I gained at Citi.

HSBC is one of the world’s largest and most respected banking and financial services organizations,
 with a deep-rooted history in APAC.
